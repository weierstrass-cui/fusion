                        Certain active participant behavior may result in a punitive reduction of that participant’s security bond (through deletion or reallocation) or a reduction in the amount of their FSN reward. The extent of the punishment will depend on the misbehavior in question and will be pre-determined by the protocol.

                        In order to make a better use of the FSN token, a 5% reserve can give the Foundation more discretion to foster the ecosystem of FUSION in the future.
